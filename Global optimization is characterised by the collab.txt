Global optimization is characterised by the collaborated activity of global-local interaction and local leader and effector interaction. As depicted in equation (2), the global and local leaders interact to control gross motion, thereby setting a trend to govern overall movement direction. HC is the hierarchical crossover parameter. The hierarchical crossover is controlled by the conditional equation ic<(HC*in), which determines the optimal transition from (2) to (3) which enables smoother convergence is the system.
Any successful optimization algorithm involves a trade-off between few important criteria's. These include:- a) Fast Convergence b) Robust Optimization. Robust optimization implies avoiding local minima in the distributed to attain successful convergence.
Carefully picking HC, enables our algorithm to optimize the trade-off so as to achieve faster and better convergence in comparison to several algorithm.
